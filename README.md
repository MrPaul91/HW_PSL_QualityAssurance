Here is our challenge

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-sort/problem

In this repo you can see our homework of quality assurance with TDD and BDD using JUNIT

We used TDD to write our Tests Cases (7). The 3 most important are for testing the sorting by CGPA, FNAME OR ID If it's necessary.

We did a solution too with a comparable in the class student.

We used BDD to describe each test case in the class StudentTest.
